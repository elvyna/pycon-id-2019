# README

This directory stores the script used to prepare my talk on R-Ladies Auckland Lightning Talk event on August 18, 2020. The slides are uploaded on [SlideDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/elvyna/how-do-people-spend-their-days-a-data-viz-journey) and also as a PDF here.
P.S. I don't upload the datasets - hopefully the script illustrates the dataset structure a bit.
